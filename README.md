## UX


### Colour Scheme

I have used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/8052ec-d161ff-333333-f2f2f2-dddddd) to display and create my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/readme/color-palette.png)

- `#8052ec` used for background gradient one.
- `#d161ff` used for background gradient one and as the scoreboard buttons.
- `#333333` used for text shadows and background effects.
- `#f2f2f2` used for primary texts.
- `#DDDDDD` used for top-navifation hover.


### Typography

For Love Tic Tac Toe I used Google Font 'Raleway' as my primary font with Sans-serif being my secondary text.

- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Sans-serif] was used as my secondary text should my primary font not load.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

### CSS Implementation

Raleway font is included at the beginning of my CSS file using the '@import' method from google Fonts. This ensure's that Raleway is loaded as soon as CSS is loaded.

```css
/* Importing Google Fonts */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Raleway:wght@400;600&display=swap');
```

## Wireframes

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.
Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

Alternatively, dropdowns are a way to condense several wireframes into a collapsible menu to save space.
Dropdowns in Markdown are considered some of the only acceptable HTML components that are allowed for assessment purposes.

**IMPORTANT**! **IMPORTANT**! **IMPORTANT**!
The example below uses the `details` and `summary` code elements.
However, for these scripts to work, I've had to add spaces within the `< >` elements.

You MUST remove these spaces for it to work properly on your own README/TESTING files.
Remove the spaces within the `< >` brackets for the `details` and `summary` code elements,
for the Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop wireframes.

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

Use this space to provide attribution links to any images, videos, or audio files borrowed from online.
A few examples have been provided below to give you some ideas.

If you're the owner (or a close acquaintance) of all media files, then make sure to specify this.
Let the assessors know that you have explicit rights to use the media files within your project.

Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every media file used, not just a generic link to the main site!
The list below is by no means exhaustive. Within the Code Institute Slack community, you can find more "free media" links
by sending yourself the following command: `!freemedia`.
