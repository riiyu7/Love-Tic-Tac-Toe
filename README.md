## UX


### Colour Scheme

I have used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/8052ec-d161ff-333333-f2f2f2-dddddd) to display and create my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/readme/color-palette.png)

- `#8052ec` used for background gradient one.
- `#d161ff` used for background gradient one and as the scoreboard buttons.
- `#333333` used for text shadows and background effects.
- `#f2f2f2` used for primary texts.
- `#DDDDDD` used for top-navifation hover.


### Typography

For Love Tic Tac Toe I used Google Font 'Raleway' as my primary font with Sans-serif being my secondary text.

- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Sans-serif] was used as my secondary text should my primary font not load.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

### CSS Implementation

Raleway font is included at the beginning of my CSS file using the '@import' method from google Fonts. This ensure's that Raleway is loaded as soon as CSS is loaded.

```css
/* Importing Google Fonts */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Raleway:wght@400;600&display=swap');
```

## Wireframes

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.
Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

Alternatively, dropdowns are a way to condense several wireframes into a collapsible menu to save space.
Dropdowns in Markdown are considered some of the only acceptable HTML components that are allowed for assessment purposes.

**IMPORTANT**! **IMPORTANT**! **IMPORTANT**!
The example below uses the `details` and `summary` code elements.
However, for these scripts to work, I've had to add spaces within the `< >` elements.

You MUST remove these spaces for it to work properly on your own README/TESTING files.
Remove the spaces within the `< >` brackets for the `details` and `summary` code elements,
for the Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop wireframes.

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
