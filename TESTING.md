# Testing

Welcome, in this file I will discuss in this file the testing I have completed to ensure that all elements are tested and are responsive across diffrent devices.

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.



## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Page      | W3C URL                                                                                                   | Screenshot                                                       | Notes           |
| ---       | ---                                                                                                       | ---                                                              | ---             |
| Home      | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Friiyu7.github.io%2FTic-Tac-Toe%2Findex.html)         | ![screenshot](documentation/test/validator-w3-index.html.png)    | Pass: No Errors |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.


| File      | Jigsaw URL                                                                                               | Screenshot                                             | Notes           |
| ---       | ---                                                                                                      | ---                                                    | ---             |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Friiyu7.github.io%2FTic-Tac-Toe) | ![screenshot](documentation/test/validator-w3-css.png) | Pass: No Errors |


### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| File      | Screenshot                                                   | Notes           |
| ---       | ---                                                          | ---             |
| script.js | ![screenshot](documentation/test/validator-jshint-scipt.png) | Pass: No Errors |


## Browser Compatibility

I have used different browsers to check any browser compatibility issues.

The browsers which I used were:

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)


I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Home                                                    | Play                                                   | Feedback                                                   | Thank You                                                  | Notes             |
| ---     | ---                                                     | ---                                                    | ---                                                        | ---                                                        | ---               |

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

## Defensive Programming

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | | | | | |
| | Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y | Tested the feature by doing Y | The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y | Test concluded and passed | ![screenshot](documentation/feature01.png) |
| | Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y | Tested the feature by doing Y | The feature did not respond to A, B, or C. | I did Z to the code because something was missing | ![screenshot](documentation/feature02.png) |

Another way of performing defensive testing is a simple Pass/Fail for each test.
The assessors prefer the above method, with the full test explained, but this is also acceptable in most cases.

When in doubt, use the above method instead, and delete the table below.

This section is primarily used for JavaScript and Python applications,
but feel free to use this section to document any HTML/CSS bugs you might run into.

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- JS `'let'` or `'const'` or `'template literal syntax'` or `'arrow function syntax (=>)'` is available in ES6 (use `'esversion: 11'`) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

## Unfixed Bugs

I started the project using the desktop view and towards the end of the project I added media queries which resulted in inconsistent CSS on my play.HTML page, the following bugs were found:

- Bug with Turn counter position

    ![screenshot](documentation/test/bug-media-queries.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle the position of the turn counter, but as I changed the CSS, the position kept varying with different devices.


    - Bug with Win message position

    ![screenshot](documentation/test/bug-2-media-queries.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle the position of the message and I experienced a similar problem as above.


    - Future resolution: I will attempt to create the same game but using root variables as well creating the website from lower dimensions to higher to ensure the elements like this are consitent across all devices
